			<description>&lt;p&gt;ARKit framework provides the captured skeleton of a person from iPhone&amp;rsquo;s back camera in real-time. Detailed three-dimensional joint data can be extracted from the skeleton such as the distance of Right Hand Joint with respect to Root / Hip Joint. Below are the skeleton and some of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/Skeleton.png&#34; alt=&#34;skeleton&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;skeleton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARKit uses a right-handed coordinate system where the direction of view is along the negative Z-axis, as illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/Coordinate.png&#34; alt=&#34;coordinate&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;coordinate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to explore the pattern of jumping jacks, a video of a professional coach doing jumping jacks is fed into the ARKit framework. As a simple start, 6 kinds of data are chosen where LHX means &amp;ldquo;Left-Hand joint data on X-axis&amp;rdquo; etc. From the data, it can be concluded that a jumping jack has a certain pattern and the absolute value of two hands or feet are almost identical in the same direction. If the minimum of RHY and LHY are regarded as a beginning of jumping jacks, the next appearance of minimum stands for the ending of jumping jacks roughly. In this way, the algorithm detects the minimum and maximum, combines the joint data of the left/right hand/foot to create a threshold. If the derived condition is satisfied, the count label would increase by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/JumpingJacksData.png&#34; alt=&#34;jumpingJacksData&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;jumpingJacksData&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time and count would be frozen when the pause button is pressed and would be unfrozen when the resume button is pressed. The stop button would save and upload this training record into the cloud database and then return to the Workout Page. Below is the screenshot of the Jumping Jacks Detection Page.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Login, Register, and Edit Profile page are shown below. Registration requires name, password, gender, age, weight, height, and email. Login asks for a valid registered email and the correct password. In the Edit Profile page, users are allowed to edit all information except for email. Users can upload a picture from iPhone’s gallery or take a picture as their profile pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/RegisterPage.png&#34; alt=&#34;Login, Register, and Edit Profile page&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Login, Register, and Edit Profile page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARCoach can be divided into 4 major parts, namely Activity, Plan, Workouts, and Me. Below are the screenshots of each tab bar page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/MainPage.png&#34; alt=&#34;Activity, Plan, Workouts, and Me page&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Activity, Plan, Workouts, and Me page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Activity page, ARCoach would access health data from iPhone through HealthKit and display them. It also would grab history data of training minutes and training days from Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Plan page, JTAppleCalendar is displayed. It can be scrolled to select the date. In the future, ARCoach would link the date and training plan together​(TO-DO)​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Activity page, instead of just playing a video that instructs users how to do the exercise, ARCoach would combine AR and VR technology, analyze the motion based on motion tracking results in order to give feedback to users. The algorithm would make use of important joints of the body, such as right hand, right shoulder, head, hip, right foot joints. By analyzing the relationship between the joints, to determine whether the users have done the workouts correctly​(TO-DO)​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Me page, it records the personal information related to sport and display the profile picture and user’s name. The setting button on the top right would direct the user to the Edit Profile page.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;ARCoach uses Firebase as authentication and database. User registers in ARCoach and ARCoach would send the user’s email and password to Firebase and get a complicated UID in return. The user’s information would be uploaded into Firebase realtime database under the root of the user’s UID. The free version of Firebase supports up to 100 connections simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/Architecture.png&#34; alt=&#34;Architecture&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Architecture of ARCoach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authentication in Firebase is shown below. It includes an email address as an ID and an auto-generated UID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../img/Firebase_Authentication.png&#34; alt=&#34;Firebase Authentication&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Firebase Authentication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user’s information is stored under the root of the corresponding UID. For example, under the UID tLo3EXZPbXea6I69kuXbq5WQI873, there are two nodes named profile and profilePicture. Profile node saves basic information such as age, email, gender, height, weight, and name. ProfilePicture node saves the URL of the profile picture which is stored in Firebase Storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Firebase Realtime Database&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This project aims to develop an iOS application ARCoach for giving instant fitness instructions and feedbacks armed with body motion tracking through the iPhone’s camera, providing exercises with virtual objects using immersive technology Augmented Reality(AR). It helps users to do exercises correctly at home without hiring a coach or buying extra wearable devices, meanwhile enjoy the immersive experience brought by AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike some fitness applications that need input data from a wearable device, ARCoach uses the camera of iPhone to track body motion and extract movement information, users, therefore, need not buy an extra wearable device for fitness. Besides, ARCoach takes advantage of the powerful ARKit Framework of iOS and corresponding Apple device’s support, thus it improves interaction and creates a virtually fun environment for users. ARCoach gives instructions of indoor exercise includes Lunges, Crunch, Push up, Sit up and Squat, it tracks movements of users in real-time and produces a 3D skeleton. It analyses the data of 3D skeleton joints, compares with the recordings data from the professional coaches in order to give instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
